// In this file we have some data that the other source files will use.
// Most of this data is stored in constants.
// Constants are just variables that never change. By convention,
// We write constants with upper case letters.

// The GAME_WIDTH and GAME_HEIGHT constants denote the size
// of the game area in pixels and is used in engine-utilities.js.
const GAME_WIDTH = 500;//375

// These constants represent the width and height of an enemy in pixels
// as well as the maximum number of enemies on screen at any given time.

const ENEMY_HEIGHT = 156;//156
const MAX_ENEMIES = 3;//3

// These constants represent the player width and height.
